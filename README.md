# spawn-mocha-parallel

beta - work in progress

This let you run your test in parallel by spawning several child processes.
It was designed to be used with [gulp][gulp], but since it relies only
on npm, it may be used within various configuration.

## Credits

This was originaly a fork of [gulp-spawn-mocha] but has deviated a lot since
then.
